# Scenarios

[//]: # (!!! info "SEDOS - Scenario frame details")

**Base scenario ToKio - technology-open & cost-optimal**
Which technologies can reduce GHG emissions from energy use to a targeted level at minimum cost
(e.g. climate neutrality by 2045)?

**Scenario variation RIGa: Reduced import dependency for fossil gas**
How can the dependency on fossil gas imports, including LNG imports, be reduced to a specified minimum level at minimum 
cost while complying with the GHG reduction targets?

**Scenario variation SienA/B: sector integration**
In which areas can sector integration make a greater contribution to GHG reduction?

- SienA: Specification of a minimum use of hydrogen or H2 derivatives.
- SienB: Specification of a minimum domestic RE electricity generation.
