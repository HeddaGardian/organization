## Changes in technology

One interesting question is how the technologies used in the industry will change over the decades. 
The two sub-sectors of copper and aluminum were selected for a closer look at this development. 
The following diagrams show the installed capacity per year in each case, with the colored background describing the technology used.

In both diagrams it can be seen that over the years the installed capacity consists more and more of new technologies. 

Especially in the diagram for copper it can be observed that in 2050 only the newest and most innovative technology accounts for the total installed capacity.
In the second diagram, describing the installed capacity for the aluminium industry, it can be seen, that from 2045 on only new technologies form the installed capacity.
A new technology was introduced in the sec sector as early as 2025, which will then become established over the next few decades and replace the older technology.
A similar thing happens in the pri sector, where in 2035 a new and highly innovative technology is introduced and takes over the total capacity for this sector within the next 10 years.


## Energy flow and use of hydrogen

Another topic that will be considered below is energy flow of the subsectors in the industry.
In connection with that analysis, the development of the use of hydrogen in the industrial sector can also be examined.
Therefor three diagrams were created showing the energy flow in the individual subsectors of the industry.
Here can be seen that while currently no hydrogen is being used in the indsutry sectors, 
it will already play a major role in 2045 and thus the use of coal and methane can be drastically reduced
