In both diagrams it can be seen that over the years the installed capacity consists more and more of new technologies. 

Especially in the diagram for copper it can be observed that in 2050 only the newest and most innovative technology accounts for the total installed capacity.
In the second diagram, describing the installed capacity for the aluminium industry, it can be seen, that from 2045 on only new technologies form the installed capacity.
A new technology was introduced in the sec sector as early as 2025, which will then become established over the next few decades and replace the older technology.
A similar thing happens in the pri sector, where in 2035 a new and highly innovative technology is introduced and takes over the total capacity for this sector within the next 10 years.
