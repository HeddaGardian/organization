## Changes in technology

One interesting question is how the technologies used in the industry will change over the decades. 
The two sub-sectors of copper and aluminum were selected for a closer look at this development. 
The following diagrams show the installed capacity per year in each case, with the colored background describing the technology used.

The diagrams demonstrate the increasing prevalence of advanced technologies in the installed capacity of both the copper
and aluminum industries over time.

In the copper industry, the first diagram illustrates a clear transition: by 2050, the entire installed capacity is 
composed of the most recent and innovative technologies, signifying a complete shift away from older methods. 
The gradual introduction of these advanced systems, especially visible after 2035, shows a clear industry-wide 
adaptation to newer production technologies.

The second diagram, which focuses on the aluminum industry, similarly shows that from 2045 onwards, only new 
technologies constitute the total installed capacity. Interestingly, the adoption of newer technologies in the secondary 
aluminum production sector begins as early as 2025. This early transition in secondary production paves the way for 
these technologies to dominate by mid-century, effectively replacing outdated systems. In the primary aluminum 
production sector, a breakthrough occurs in 2035 with the introduction of a highly innovative technology, which rapidly 
supplants the older methods within a decade. 

## Energy supply of the energy-intensive industry sectors


The diagrams illustrate the models transformation of energy supply within various industrial subsectors between 
2021 and 2050, with a particular focus on the integration of hydrogen.

In 2021, the industrial sector heavily relied on traditional energy sources such as coal and methane, 
as depicted in the left diagram. Coal plays a significant role in powering steel production, while methane and other 
fossil fuels are prominent across various subsectors.

In comparison, the 2050 diagram presents a drastically different energy landscape. Hydrogen emerges as a pivotal energy 
source, especially in the steel sector, where it completely replaces coal. The reduction of methane usage is also 
evident as the transition toward cleaner energy sources reshapes the entire industry. This shift underscores the 
declining relevance of coal in industrial processes and highlights hydrogenâ€™s growing importance in decarbonizing 
energy-intensive industries.
