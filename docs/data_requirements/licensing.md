## Data Licensing

Open Data is one of the main criteria of the Reference Energy System (RES) which we will develop within the SEDOS project. Thus, the input and output data sets should follow the [FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and require open licensing.

### Which data licenses are suitable for RES?

1. For the data collection in WP3-8, you should use data published under one of the listed licenses below. 
2. Add the license spdx-id and/or correct attribution to the respective metadata.
3. If your data is published under an open license which is not listed below, please contact *sarah.berendes@rl-institut.de.* **Please note:** non-conformant clauses such as NC (non commercial) and ND (no derivates) are **NOT** open data licenses and should not be used.

### Using data without an open license?

If you want to use a data set without a license or without an open data license, try the following steps: 

1. Contact the authors of the data set and ask for either the license or send a request for user and relicensing rights. Templates in DE and EN can be found here: <https://bwsyncandshare.kit.edu/f/2369369032>. Please add *sarah.berendes@rl-institut.de* to CC of the Email-loop and store a positive response here: <https://bwsyncandshare.kit.edu/f/2369341357> 
2. You can use the unlicensed data if you only extract a considerable small subset of a larger data set. If your data set has no license, please indicate the license as "unknown" in the license field of the meta data. If the data set has a license, add the spdx-id to the license field of the metadata.
