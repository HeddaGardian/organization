# Data Licencing

In the SEDOS project, Open Data is one of the main criteria for developing the Reference Energy System (RES) database. 
Open Data implies adequate licencing as a legal requirement, hence why this section aims to bring you up to speed regarding the nitty-gritty of licencing. 
By the end of this section, you'll be able to licence your input data adequately.

## Which data licences are suitable in SEDOS?

1. For the data collection in WP3-8, you should choose data published under one of the listed licences below. 
2. Add the licence spdx-id and/or correct attribution for respective source in the metadata ([oem-key 12.4.1-5](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oemetadata/blob/develop/metadata/latest/metadata_key_description.md#source-keys)).
3. If your data is published under an open licence not listed below, please get in touch with *datenzentrum@rl-institut.de.*
> _Please note:_ non-conformant clauses such as <br> NC (non commercial) and ND (no derivates) <br>are **NOT** Open Data licences and must not be used.

## Using data without an open licence?

If you want to use a data set without a licence or an open data licence, try the following steps: 

1. Contact the authors of the data set and ask for either the licence or send a request for user-and relicensing rights. Templates in DE and EN can be found here: <https://bwsyncandshare.kit.edu/f/2369369032>. Please add *datenzentrum@rl-institut.de* to the CC of the Email-loop and store a positive response here: <https://bwsyncandshare.kit.edu/f/2369341357> 
2. You can use the unlicensed data if you only extract a considerable small subset of a larger data set. If your data set has no licence, please indicate the licence as "unknown" in the licence field of the metadata. If the data set has a licence, add the spdx-id to the licence field of the metadata.
