# SEDOS Datamodel

Within the SEDOS project two datamodels are used:

1. **OEDatamodel** is used to represent input/output data for energysystem modelling. 
This datamodel will be used to gather input data from AP4-8, apply ontology from metadata to it and 
restructure it in order to make it available for simulation models. 
Further information about the OEDatamodel can be found in the documentation at [sedos-project/oedatamodel](https://github.com/sedos-project/oedatamodel).

2. **Parameter Datamodel** is used for preprocessed input data. 
This datamodel is supposed to be used by AP4-8 in order to store data on the OpenEnergyPlatform (OEP).
