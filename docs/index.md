# SEDOS Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the SEDOS project!

The documentation gives an overview of the tools in SEDOS, as well as important conventions for their usage.
In the project, we aim to establish a streamlined data management process with as much automation as practical.

The documentation is structured in two main parts 

1. [SEDOS-specific data requirements](./data_requirements/input_data.md) 
2. [Instructions on how to contribute data](./how_to_contribute_data.md)
